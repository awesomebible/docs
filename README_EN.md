## ðŸš€ Project Structure

In this Astro + Starlight project you can find the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€â”€ assets/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€â”€ content/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€â”€ docs/
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚ â””â”€â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight searches for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` folder. Each file is displayed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded with relative links in Markdown.

Static assets, such as favicons or Open Graph images, should be stored in the `public/` folder.
