> We want to inspire people about God's awesome plan, that's why we explain the Bible in a simple, understandable and accessible way for everyone!

## 1. God has a plan
We believe that God has a plan. Everything that happens, happens because God has allowed it to happen.

We believe that we are part of His plan and that He has great plans for us.

> *For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord.*
> *For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.* ~ [Isaiah 55,8-9](https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV/Isaiah55%3A8-9)

We walk this path with God and we trust God to lead us.
