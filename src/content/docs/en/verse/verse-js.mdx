import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

To use the Javascript library, add the following script tag to your document:

```javascript
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@awesomebible/verse-js@1.0.0/index.js"></script>
```
or install the NPM package:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="npm">
        ```bash
        npm install @awesomebible/verse-js
        ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn add @awesomebible/verse-js
        ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm install @awesomebible/verse-js
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now you'll have to import the function:

```javascript
import { VerseReplace } from '@awesomebible/verse-js';

```

Add an image tag with the class "awb-verse" where you want the verse image to appear.

```html
<img class="awb-verse">
```

At the very bottom of the document, the `verseReplace()` function must be called:

```html
<script defer>
    verseReplace("https://verse.awesomebible.de/img/");
</script>

```

:::note
The server from which the images are loaded can be customized by the `versePath` variable.
The path must contain the protocol (https://), the domain and the path to the image directory.
