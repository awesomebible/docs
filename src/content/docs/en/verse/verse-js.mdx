import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import PackageManagerTabs from '@components/tabs/PackageManagerTabs.astro'

To use the Javascript library, add the following script tag to your document:

```javascript
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@awesomebible/verse-js@1.0.0/index.js"></script>
```
or install the NPM package:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  # create a new project with npm
  npm install @awesomebible/verse-js
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  # create a new project with pnpm
  pnpm install @awesomebible/verse-js
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  # create a new project with yarn
  yarn add @awesomebible/verse-js
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>


Now you'll have to import the function:

```javascript
import { VerseReplace } from '@awesomebible/verse-js';

```

Add an image tag with the class "awb-verse" where you want the verse image to appear.

```html
<img class="awb-verse">
```

At the very bottom of the document, the `verseReplace()` function must be called:

```html
<script defer>
    verseReplace("https://verse.awesomebible.de/img/");
</script>

```

:::note
The server from which the images are loaded can be customized by the `versePath` variable.
The path must contain the protocol (https://), the domain and the path to the image directory.
