  <Card title="Open Source Software" icon="pencil">
    With Open Source Software, everyone involved profits off of it. With WordPress - one of the biggest open source projects - for example, awesomeBible wouldn't exist.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Community" icon="rocket">
    We develop Software as Community Projects: Everyone can contribute Code, Docs & Design - completely in the sense of the community of the children of God.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transparency" icon="open-book">
    Transparency is important to us, therefore we document every step of our journey and every detail of our projects and undertakings.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Read the Bible" icon="open-book">
    Now there is only one thing left to say: Read the bible - and if you like also these docs. ;)
