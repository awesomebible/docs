> With my.awesomeBible begins a new generation of Bible study. *Your new generation of Bible study.*

my.awesomeBible takes a new approach for bible apps.
We focus on communication and Bible study as real-time collaboration.
Our goal is to connect people and give them the tools they need to discover and understand God's Word.

## Our mission ⭐
awesomeBible's mission is to tell *everyone* about God's awesome plan.

my.awesomeBible builds on that.
With this project, we want to help Christians hear God's Word wherever they are and be able to interact with it and share it.

We are not building my.awesomeBible for profit, but because it is something we want for ourselves.
We built my.awesomeBible with the values we care about - community, freedom, and privacy - not to become the next Billion Dollar Unicorn.

We're advertising *a new generation of Bible study*:
